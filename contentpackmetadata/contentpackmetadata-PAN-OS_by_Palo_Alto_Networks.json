				"description": "This playbook creates a DNS sinkhole in a PAN-OS firewall. It does the following:\n1. Finds a security rule that allows DNS traffic from the internal network to the internet using the \"Security Policy Match\" feature against traffic from the internal DNS server/s to the public DNS server.\n2. Creates or adds an existing anti-spyware security profile to the security rule/s that were found.\n3. Sets the DNS Signature Source under the DNS Policies configuration of the security profile with the \"sinkhole\" action.\n4. Creates an address object for the sinkhole address so that it can be referenced later in a deny rule (the sinkhole IP constantly rotates).\n5. Creates a new security rule to deny traffic to the sinkhole address object, in order to generate traffic logs for the compromised systems. The IPs of the compromised systems can then be retrieved using the \"PAN-OS - Extract IPs From Traffic Logs To Sinkhole\" playbook.\n\nOnce the configuration is completed, the playbook will create a Tag object and tag the relevant security rules to indicate that sinkholing is configured. That tag will be checked in consecutive playbook runs in order to minimize the actions done on the firewall and time time spent in the playbook execution.\n\nHow it works:\nA DNS sinkhole can be used to identify infected hosts on a network where there is an internal DNS Server in-route to the firewall that causes the reference of the original source IP address of the host that first originated the query to be lost (the query is received by the internal DNS server, and the internal DNS server sources a new query if the name-to-IP resolution is not locally cached).\n\nThis causes the firewall to report observations of malicious DNS queries in the Threat logs where the source IP of the malicious DNS query is the Internal DNS server, which would force the administrator to look into the DNS Server logs to try to trace down what was the infected host that originally sourced the malicious DNS query.\n\nAfter a security profile with a \"sinkhole\" action for domains that are listed in the DNS signature source is applied to a rule that allows DNS traffic from the internal server/s to the external one, the threat logs will show that requests from the internal DNS server/s were sinkholed. However, the compromised systems will not appear in those logs.\n\nIn order to find the IP addresses of those systems, a new rule denying all requests to our sinkhole address needs to be created. Since the infected systems received a forged DNS response (due to the security profile involved in our previous step), they will now try to connect to the sinkhole address, assuming it is their C\u0026C server. The new rule will deny the subsequent attempts of those systems when they try to access the sinkhole address, and log them.\n\n\nAssumptions:\n- The domains that should be sinkholed are already in a DNS signature source. It can be one of the following sources available in PAN-OS:\n1. An existing External Dynamic List (EDL) of type Domain configured in the PAN-OS firewall. Note: XSOAR simplifies the process of creating an EDL, with the Export Generic Indicators Service integration.\n2. Palo Alto Networks Content-delivered malicious domains\n3. DNS Security Categories available with a DNS Security subscription.\n- There is at least one internal DNS server that is sending the DNS requests out through the firewall to a specific public DNS server.",
