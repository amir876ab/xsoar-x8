If only one indicator type exists in the query, only one EDL is created. \nThe playbook then creates EDL objects directing to the indicator lists and firewall policy rules in PAN-OS. \n- It is recommended to configure a dedicated EDL Service instance for the usage of this playbook.\n- If necessary to edit or update the EDL query after this playbook run, use the panorama-edit-edl command and panorama integration to update the URL containing the indicator query syntax.",
