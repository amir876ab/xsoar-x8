  Changes the remediation SLA once a change in incident severity occurs.
  This is done automatically and the changes can be configured to your needs.

  # ##### Help #####
  # This is an example script. The script is used to change the Remediation SLA of an incident,
  # when the severity of the incident changes for any reason. Please copy this script and make changes to your liking.
  # The Configuration section is there to help you easily configure the script with your desired SLAs.

  # The CRITICAL_SLA field defines the number of minutes that you would want an incident with critical severity to have,
  # in its Remediation SLA field.
  # The NONCRITICAL_SLA field defines the number of days that you would want an incident with non-critical severity to have,
  # in its Remediation SLA field.
  # The NONCRITICAL_SLA field can also be configured in minutes if you want.

  # Note that the SLA can be set with a number that represents minutes instead of days, like so:
  # demisto.executeCommand("setIncident",{'sla': 30, "slaField":"remediationsla"})
  # but it can also be set with a number that represents a complete date and time structure, like so:
  # demisto.executeCommand("setIncident",{'sla': 2018-12-26T12:10:24Z, "slaField":"remediationsla"})
  # To get the date+time structure, you can use timedelta, like so: newsla = now + datetime.timedelta(days=2)
  # then, you would use this to convert it to the date+time structure that can be passed to the SLA field:
  # newsla = newsla.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+00:00')

  # Since this script is to be triggered by a change of a field,
  # you may want to make use of the changes to the field in your script.
  # For example, in this case, when the severity of an incident is changed, we want to check if it is now critical, or not.
  # We do this by using demisto.args()['new'], to get the new value of the severity.
  # The field changes can be obtained in the following way:
  # The name of the triggered field is in: demisto.args()['name']
  # The field's old value is in: demisto.args()['old']
  # The field's new value is in: demisto.args()['new']
  # To print the whole argument structure, use this: demisto.results(demisto.args())


  # ##### Configuration #####
  CRITICAL_SLA = 60  # In minutes
  NONCRITICAL_SLA = 6  # In days


  def main():
      # ##### Logic #####
      args_sev = demisto.args().get('new')
      now = datetime.utcnow()

      if args_sev == 'Critical':
          return_results('Severity changed to Critical')
          demisto.executeCommand("setIncident", {'sla': CRITICAL_SLA, "slaField": "remediationsla"})

      else:
          return_results('Severity changed to Not Critical')
          newsla = now + timedelta(days=NONCRITICAL_SLA)
          newsla = newsla.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+00:00')
          demisto.executeCommand("setIncident", {'sla': newsla, "slaField": "remediationsla"})
