The following are the default CIDR ranges for private IPv4 addresses:\n- 10.0.0.0/8 (range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)\n- 172.16.0.0/12 (range: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255)\n- 192.168.0.0/16 (range: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255)\nIn addition to ranges, it's also possible to add specific IP addresses to the list. You may also tag IPs or IP ranges by adding a comma after the IP or range, and then adding the tag that you want to tag the corresponding IP indicators with.",
